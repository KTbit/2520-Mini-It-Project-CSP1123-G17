Recipe Finder and Generator Web Application
- A Flask-based web app to help MMU students find budget-friendly, easy-to-cook recipes based on available ingredients.

To set the project up on your personal device: 
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment (this is done in the terminal. For clarity, I did this in VSCode, but I believe you can perform this on any other IDE): `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate venv:
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - For Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (basically every framework used in the project, as per listed below)
5. To run the app: `python app.py`
